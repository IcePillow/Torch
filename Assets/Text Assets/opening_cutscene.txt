It was dawn when I lost my friend.
We are adventurers by trade, you know. So you might think he was claimed by something heroic. A monster, a sacrifice. In the end, it was nothing quite so glorious as that.
It was the cold that took him. He fell ill after a day of travels and it only worsened through the night. I stayed with him until morning. It was all I could do.
I couldn't save him.
It's said that one's soul burns on in a flame. The goddess of light and fire delivers her followers to death itself when the last embers of their spirit are extinguished. By some miracle, I caught my friend's flame before it rose to the sky like a smoke. I have not lost him yet.
There is a temple to the goddess atop this mountain. A place wayward souls can call home. A place they can be restored to life.
I will make it there. Whatever it takes.
