1	AKKI	Will you chill out?
2	AKKI	You know, take a break? Stop and smell the flowers? Not that there are any on this oversized rock. Jeez, you could've picked a nice place to take me. This is worse than the dump I died in.
3	AKKI	Not funny? OK.
		
INTRO_2		
1	AKKI	Do we need to be going so fast? There are puddles everywhere; you'll slip at this rate. Fall and break your neck. Then we can be dead together, heh. 
2	HAN	...
3	AKKI	Alright, I get it. I just want you to be careful, you know.
4	AKKI	You haven't got me to watch your back anymore. Or your front, for that matter. 
5	AKKI	And it wouldn't kill you to take it easy. It's not a race. It's not like it's the end of the world or anything.  
		
INTRO_3	(room with burnable block)	
1	AKKI	Woo! You see that? That was teamwork!
		
INTRO_4	(mountain exterior)	
1	AKKI	Oh wow.
2	AKKI	Maybe it is the end of the world.
		
INTRO_5	(after being exposed to rain)	
1	AKKI	Well, that sucked. Hey, still alive and kicking though!
2	AKKI	You know, maybe this isn't so good of an idea. What with the storm and all. Rain and fire might not work out too well.
3	HAN	...
		
NPC_1		
1	AKKI	Woah, a person! Someone else is really climbing this mountain in the middle of a flood? Let's go say hi!
2	HAN	...
3	AKKI	Yeah, yeah, you're on a mission, I got it. But they're all alone in an empty cave! What if they need help?
4	HAN	...
